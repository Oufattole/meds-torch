  This file specifies the base configuration for the prediction of in ICU mortality, leveraging only the first
  24 hours of data after ICU admission, with a 24 hour gap between the input window and the target window.
  Patients who die or are discharged from the ICU in the gap window are excluded. Patients who die in the same
  hospital stay but in a subsequent ICU stay are **not** positive labels for this task.
  Note that this task is in-**ICU** mortality, not in-**hospital** mortality or **30-day** mortality, which
  are different tasks.
  Note that this task is predicting the outcome for a patient's entire ICU admission, not just the first 24
  hours or the subsequent 24 hours after the trigger event. Imminent mortality (on various time-scales) are
  different tasks.
