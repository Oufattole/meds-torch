description: >-
  This file specifies the base configuration for the prediction of in hospital mortality, leveraging only the
  first 48 hours of data after admission, with a 24 hour gap between the input window and the target window.
  Patients who die or are discharged in the gap window are excluded. Note that this task is in-**hospital**
  mortality, not in-**ICU** mortality or **30-day** mortality, which are different tasks.
  Note that this task is predicting the outcome for a patient's entire hospital stay, not just the first 48
  hours or the subsequent 48 hours after the trigger event. Imminent mortality (on various time-scales) are
  different tasks.
